# Python Template

This is a template project for Python, designed to streamline the creation of Python projects using (What I think are)
best practices.

## Features

- Code formatting and linting using [Ruff](https://ruff.rs).
- Type checking with [Mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io).
- Pre-commit hooks to maintain code quality.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with this template:

1. **Clone the repository or use the template directly via GitHub.**

2. **Install Poetry:**

   Ensure you have [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed. If not, you can install it using:
   ```bash
   pip install poetry
   ```
   > **Note:** This template is set up using Poetry version 1.8.3.

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   poetry install
   ```

4. **Ready to Implement:**

   You are now ready to implement your project. Keep in mind that this is a base template and not a fully functioning
   application.

## CI/CD Workflow

This project includes a continuous integration (CI) workflow that is triggered on every push and pull request, using
GitHub Actions to run the following jobs:

1. **Setup**: Checks out the code, sets up Python, and installs dependencies using Poetry.
2. **Format**: Formats the code with Ruff.
3. **Lint**: Runs linting on the codebase with Ruff.
4. **Type Check**: Checks for type consistency using Mypy.
5. **Create Release**: Automatically creates a GitHub release when code is pushed to the main branch.

### Workflow File

The CI workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/ci_check_release.yml`.

## Dependencies

This project includes the following dependencies:

- **Core Dependencies**:
    - `python`: ^3.12
    - `loguru`: ^0.7.2

- **Development Dependencies**:
    - `ruff`: ^0.6.7 (for code linting and formatting)
    - `mypy`: ^1.11.2 (for type checking)
    - `pre-commit`: ^3.8.0 (for managing Git hooks)

## Code Quality

This repository employs several tools to ensure code quality:

- **Ruff**: A fast Python linter and formatter that enforces a consistent style and detects potential errors.
- **Mypy**: A static type checker for Python that ensures type safety.

## Pre-commit Hooks

To set up pre-commit hooks for automatic formatting and linting on commit, ensure `pre-commit` is installed:

```bash
poetry install
```

Then, install the hooks:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

Once installed, the hooks will run automatically before each commit.

### Pre-commit Hooks Configuration

This repository uses pre-commit hooks to enforce code quality and standards before committing changes. Hereâ€™s an
overview of the configured hooks:

#### 1. Commitlint Hook

- **Purpose**: Ensures commit messages adhere to defined conventions for consistency and clarity.

#### 2. Local Hooks

- **Ruff Format**: Automatically formats Python code according to specified rules.
- **Ruff Lint**: Performs linting to catch potential errors and maintain coding standards.
- **Mypy Type Check**: Checks type annotations for consistency and correctness in Python code.
